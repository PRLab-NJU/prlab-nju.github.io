  <p>Ran He received his bachelor's degree (2001) and his master's degree (2004) from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology (DUT). After that, he was a Ph.D. candidate in the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), where he received his Ph.D. degree in 2009. He is now a full Professor in the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR, CASIA) and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is leading a "2035 Innovation Team" of AI research in CASIA.</p>
  <p>He is interested in algorithms for biometrics (face recognition and synthesis, iris recognition, person re-identification), representation learning (pre-training networks using weak/self supervision, or transfer learning), generative learning (generative models, image generation, image translation). His work explores topics in machine/deep learning and computer vision.</p>
  <p>He has published more than 200 papers in international journals and conferences, including reputable international journals such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TIP, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TNN, IEEE TCSVT, and top level international conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS. He is serving as the Editor board member of IEEE TIP, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TBIOM, and Pattern Recognition. He has served as the Area Chair of international conferences like CVPR, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICML, LCPR, ICPR and IJCAI. He is the Fellow of IAPR (2021), and the Fellow of IEEE (2025).</p>
  <p>His research was supported by "Beijing Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars" (2018) and "NSFC for Excellent Young Scientist Programme" (2016). His research has won the "CSIG first-class Natural Science Award" (2021), "Beijing second-class Science and Technology Award" and "CAAI second-class Science and Technology Innovation Award" (2015).</p>
