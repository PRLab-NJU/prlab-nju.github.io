  <p>I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Nanjing University. Before joining Nanjing University, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2020, and then worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interest focuses on interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and medical data analysis, aiming to develop intelligent systems that advance clinical decision-making and healthcare, including disease prevention and diagnosis, lesion detection, etc. So far, I have published over 10 research papers in top-tier journals and conferences such as Medical Image Analysis, Neural Networks, and MICCAI. My recent works focus on: 1) Investigating multi-site data adaptation/harmonization to improve generalizability and transferability of constructed models; 2) Innovating machine learning methods to integrate multi-modality and multi-scale medical data for automated clinical diagnosis. Moreover, I serve as a reviewer for top international journals and conferences including TPAMI, MedIA, TMI, PR, and MICCAI.</p>
